      question: "What ingredients do you use in your treats?",
      answer: "We use only premium, natural ingredients sourced from trusted suppliers. Our treats contain no artificial preservatives, colors, or flavors. Common ingredients include free-range chicken, wild-caught salmon, organic vegetables, and natural binding agents like sweet potato and oats."
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      question: "Are your treats suitable for dogs with allergies?",
      answer: "Yes! We're very conscious of common dog allergies and clearly label all ingredients. Many of our treats are grain-free, and we avoid common allergens like corn, soy, and wheat. If your dog has specific allergies, please check the ingredient list or contact us for personalized recommendations."
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      question: "How long do the treats stay fresh?",
      answer: "Our treats have a shelf life of 6-12 months when stored in a cool, dry place. Once opened, we recommend consuming within 2-3 weeks for optimal freshness. All packages include a 'best by' date, and we recommend storing opened treats in an airtight container."
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      question: "Do you offer custom cakes for special occasions?",
      answer: "Absolutely! We love creating custom pupcakes for birthdays, gotcha days, and other special celebrations. We can customize shapes, sizes, and even add your pup's name. Please contact us at least 48 hours in advance for custom orders."
    },
    {
      id: 5,
      question: "Are your treats vet-approved?",
      answer: "Yes, all our recipes are developed in consultation with veterinary nutritionists to ensure they're safe and beneficial for dogs. However, we always recommend consulting with your vet before introducing new treats, especially if your dog has health conditions or dietary restrictions."
    },
    {
      id: 6,
      question: "What's your delivery policy?",
      answer: "We currently offer local delivery within Melbourne and surrounding areas. Delivery is usually within 2-3 business days. For areas outside our delivery zone, we're working on shipping options. Contact us to check if we deliver to your area!"
    },
    {
      id: 7,
      question: "How should I introduce new treats to my dog?",
      answer: "We recommend starting with small portions to ensure your dog tolerates the new treat well. Give 1-2 small pieces initially and monitor for any adverse reactions. Treats should make up no more than 10% of your dog's daily caloric intake."
    },
    {
      id: 8,
      question: "Do you have treats for puppies?",
      answer: "Yes! Many of our treats are suitable for puppies over 12 weeks old. We recommend our softer options like our biscuits for younger pups. Always break treats into appropriate sizes for your puppy's mouth and supervise during treat time."
